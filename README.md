# Game
Unfinished and inactive
# Dolorous is the script to go to in order to play the game. Everything related to exploration of the overworld is over there
# Battle is the script that is run when the player encounters an enemy - right now there are only two types of enemies: tomatoes and corn cobs
# Resize was used to resize sprites and animate them. The character sprites are unavailable (I don't think github allowed me to upload them) so the game is unplayable as it is here
